<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>If I could use one term to define myself, it would have to be "curious". A general curiosity in anything and everything
life presents before me has led me to many experiences, some of which have become staples of my lifestyle, others that
have been passing phases of peaked interest. My curiosity in nature has led me to become an avid outdoorsman who is
always looking for a new place to pitch a tent. My curiosity in plant life has now resulted in a serious gardening
hobby. My curiosity in music has led to my daily playlist becoming a deep rabbit hole shifting from the coldness of
black metal, to energetic electro, and over to lonely southern blues. Overall, I find myself constantly looking for
something new to learn and experience and dig way deeper into than I initially planned. This lifelong-learner attitude
has translated well into my career, as I am always seeking to challenge myself and make fit any hat a job offers to me.</p>

<p>My colleagues know me as a punctual, productive and creative individual who always brings a positive atmosphere and a
smile to the workspace. My way of thinking and attitude tends to foster both a productive and enjoyable work experience
among my team. When working alone, I put my headphones on and dedicate my focus time to the task at hand. In a team
environment, I promote ongoing discussions and brainstorming among all the members involved so that the team as a whole
can contribute as much as possible to the execution of a task.</p>

<p>I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Feel free to connect if you wish to chat about emerging
technologies, workplace experience, or anything that floats your boat really.</p>
